A simple example of RMI, designed for 2 clients.
This program has one bizarre purpose:
Two clients each send a matrix of identical order to a server, and the server adds them up.  Poor server.  And lucky for the clients that they know what dimension of matrix to send!  I don't write the exercises -- I just write the solutions.
